This is a React app showing how to achieve a few basic things with the Toolkit's React integration:

- The basic structure of a Toolkit/React application
- How to include a Surface component in your UI
- How to map node types to components
- How to bind click listeners in nodes and access the underlying data
- How to render edges
- How to pass props down into your node components

This demonstration uses a component, and not Hooks. There is a Hooks version of this available in `react-hooks-skeleton`. 

### Building the app

```
npm i 
npm run build
```

### Running the app

`webpack-dev-server` is installed as a dependency to give you a way to run the app standalone. To run the app execute this
command in the terminal:

```
npm run start
```
